###overview
The script run_analysis.R does the 5 steps listed in the Coursera Getting and Cleansing Data class project.  See the README for description of the code

###description
The code first loaded and then merges the X, y and sample training and test data.  The datasets are filter for content, labled and combined in a way that displays the averages by subject and activity.

###Variables
*X_train*, *y_train*, *X_test*, *y_test*, *subject_train* and *subject_test* contain the data from the downloaded files of the same name.
*X_dataset*, *y_dataset* and *subject_dataset* merge the previous training and test datasets.
*features* has the correct names for the X_dataset data, which are used with the column names in *features_mean_and_std*, a numeric vector that can be used to subset the previous data to get only the values we want.
*activites_lables* contains the activity data and is applied to the column names of the y_dataset.
*subject* contains the subject data header info and is applied to the column names of the subject_dataset.
*combined_dataset* contains combination of the X_dataset, y_dataset and subject_dataset in a big dataset.
*combined_dataset_average contains* the related averages by subject and activies which is later output to the file *data_averages_by_subject_and_activity.txt*
